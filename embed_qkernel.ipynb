    "classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we want to discern two different classes of points that lie in\n",
    "different corners of the plane. A linear classifier corresponds to\n",
    "drawing a line and assigning different labels to the regions on opposing\n",

    "\n",
    "![](../_static/demonstration_assets/kernels_module/linear_classification.png){.align-center\n",

    "\n",
    "The vector $\\boldsymbol{w}$ points perpendicular to the line and thus\n",
    "determine its slope. The independent term $b$ specifies the position on\n",
    "the plane. In this form, linear classification can also be extended to\n",
    "higher dimensional vectors $\\boldsymbol{x}$, where a line does not\n",

    "*hyperplane*. It is immediately clear that this method is not very\n",
    "powerful, as datasets that are not separable by a hyperplane can\\'t be\n",
    "classified without error.\n",

    "We can actually sneak around this limitation by performing a neat trick:\n",
